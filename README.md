my charger sometimes stops working, i dont notice and then the computer shuts off without warning.

this is a proof of concept of I/O Kit <-> Rust bindings. mac os native & only.
there's a library that does exactly this, cross platform: https://github.com/svartalf/rust-battery/

use that for ergonomics. i was inspired by their implementation and wanted to try writing 
extern bindings for the first time myself.
